# ISA-Interpolation
This class is made only using one python built-in library (bysect). It allows you to calculate using mathematical interpolation the realistic values for **temperature**, **pressure** and **density** given a specified altitude.

Note: This calculation is valid only for altitudes between **0 and 20,000 meters**
